								<h3>Welcome to the Willick Lab!</h3>

							<p>We work at the intersection of remote sensing and physiology to investigate biological variation at the whole plant and agroecosystem levels. Using this information, we predict how different crops respond to changing climate conditions, identify novel phenotypes for breeding programs, and develop sustainable management strategies to enhance production. While our current focus is on perennial and winter annual crops, we are always interested in collaborating on other systems!</p>
