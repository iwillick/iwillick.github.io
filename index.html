								<h3>Welcome to the Willick Lab!</h3>

							<p>We work at the intersection of remote sensing and physiology to investigate biological variation in crops at the ecophysiological and agroecosystem levels. Our recent studies have focused on apples, grapevines, strawberries, hazelnut, and winter cereals. Using this information, we predict how a plant responds to changing climate conditions, identify novel phenotypes for breeding programs, and develop sustainable management strategies to enhance production. </p>
