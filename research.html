						<p><strong>What is plant ecophysiology?</strong> Plant ecophysiology aims to understand the mechanisms that describe the interaction of plants and plant communities with their physical, chemical and biological environment. Our group seeks to address these issues in natural and controlled terrestrial ecosystems, while assessing the resilience and adaptive capacity of these systems to environmental change.</p>
						<p><strong>Why study plant cold hardiness in a warming world?</strong> One of the most pressing concerns in biology is whether we can predict how plants growing in cool climates will respond to warming seasonal temperatures. Complex feedbacks such that the responses of crops to warmer conditions could either slow or accelerate production. Our lab addresses this uncertainty by studying the physiological responses of crops and related species to shifting temperatures and water stress.</p>
						<p>We study a broad range of topics in the lab. Here are the major research questions that we are currently focused on answering:</p>

							<p>Predicted warming winters will increase the risk of winter injury to overwintering crops because of less favorable conditions to induce cold acclimation in the fall. Melting of snow cover and intermittent exposure to temperatures above 0°C will de-acclimate (deharden) plants. The combination of environmental conditions increases the exposure of plants to lethal freezing events, soil heaving and ice encasement. A long-term goal of our research is to characterize variation in cold acclimation and dehardening within native and domesticated species. Using this information we can then identify the physiological and biochemical mechanism underpinning these phenotypes. This knowledge will be crucial when breeding cultivars adapted to different geographic regions and in future environmental conditions arising from climate change.</p>

								<h4>Mechanisms of ice segregation in plants</h4>
							</header>
							<p>We are interested in characterizing how plants control intrinsic ice nucleation, modify tissues to accommodate ice, and understanding how these factors influence water distribution. Historically, we have used winter cereals as a model to study ice segregation in complex organs. Our current research focuses on understanding at the cell and tissue level how tree buds overwinter and how plant tissues survive injurious spring frosts.</p>
							<p>The control and modification of ice sinks is likely related to modifications of the cell wall. Our research in the past has aimed to understand how cell wall elasticity and rigidity can promote tissue expansion for ice accommodation and control porosity to impede ice growth and promote supercooling.</p>

The first exotherm (orange) propagates through bulk water in the xylem over a period of seconds. A second freezing event (blue) occurs over a period of minutes and propagates through the lamina in a wave like pattern. </i></p>

								<h4>Assessing phenotypes with remote sensing</h4>

							<p>We incorporate technologies such as spectral imaging and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to assess phenotypic and environmental variability. Our interest is to identify plant traits and optimize management practices to improve crop performance.</p> 
							<p>We are currently employing spectral and conventional techniques to assess how fall pneumatic defolation influences apple blush and bud cold hardiness.</p>
